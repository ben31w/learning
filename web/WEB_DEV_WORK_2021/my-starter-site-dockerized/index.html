      <h1>Ben Wright</h1>

      <h4>Computer science major at <span class="royal-blue">CNU</span></h4>
      
      <p>I enjoy lifting, running, and most forms of exercise.<br>
        I also enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, kayaking, etc.<br>
        <b>I <i>love</i> trying new things.</b>
      </p>
      
      <p id="mission-statement">Once I graduate college and find a job I'm happy 
        with, I want to live in the Newport News/Hampton Roads area. At first, I'll 
        probably live in an apartment with friends to save money and enjoy the 
        carefree life while I still can. But once I've saved enough money, I hope 
        to move out to my own house, maybe in Smithfield, VA. Eventually, I want 
        to marry someone and start a family with at least one adopted child.
      </p>

      <h4>Goal: Become a software engineer.</h4>

      <p class="spaced-out"> I enjoy <b>coding</b>, <b>solving problems</b>, and 
        <strong>making money</strong>. For these reasons, I want to be a <b>software engineer</b>, 
        and <em>I'm confident I can be successful</em>.
      </p>

      <h3 class="boxed">My Summer So Far</h3>
      
      <p class="pretty indented"> My summer has been pretty good so far. I have a 
        decent job and have had plenty of time to do the activities I enjoy, like lifting and coding.
      </p>

      <p class="pretty indented"> With all my free time, I've started taking lifting 
        more seriously and have taken measures to optimize a lean bulk up. I've 
        increased my protein and overall food consumption, while cutting out most 
        junk food and sticking to a balanced diet (I've even been eating more vegetables 
        recently). For workouts, I've been doing a pull-push-legs schedule with a 
        rest day after leg day. This is slightly more rest days than I've been doing 
        previously, which can get boring sometimes, but hopefully they will help 
        my gains in the long run by giving my muscles more time to recover. Speaking 
        of muscle recovery, I've also been trying to get more sleep; at least 7 hours 
        a night is my ideal target (I don't always reach this when I have to wake up 
        early for work, however). I've also been napping more, which has felt great.

      <p class="pretty indented">For coding, I've made it my goal to master HTML, 
        CSS, and Javascript before I go back to school. This might be a bit 
        overambitious simply because I procrastinated until July to start learning, 
        and I've also wasted considerable time writing these paragraphs.
