            <h1>Life ambitions</h1>
            <p>I'm a young, driven computer scientist who is passionate about
                his craft. I enjoy learning and solving problems using
                computers.
            </p>
            <p>My ideal career is to be a software engineer. Software enigneering
                provides a strong outlet for my creativity and capacity to learn.
                I enjoy the process of learning new programming
                languages and concepts, and applying them to create useful
                programs. I have taken the following steps towards achieving
                my career goal:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional experience.</strong> I was a software engineering
                    intern at L3Harris Technologies for two summers (2022, 2023),
                    where I assisted in the development of C5ISR and sonar
                    software. I operated primarily in the development and testing
                    stages of the agile framework. I found issues to address on the
                    team's scrum board at the beginning of each sprint. Throughout the
                    sprint, I would work on these issues and log new issues that
                    arose. When I wasn't coding, I was completing code reviews for my
                    peers.
                    <a href="professional-experience.html">More professional experience.</a>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Academic experience.</strong> As a college student, I have taken my
                    computer science education seriously. I consider this education
                    to be a critical foundation for the rest of my life, so I have
                    sought to gain a clear understanding of almost every topic I have
                    learned, like object-oriented languages (Python, Java, C++),
                    database management through SQL, algorithm design, data structures,
                    compilers and interpreters, and various frameworks.</li>
                <p>At the same time, I know that school
                    won't teach me everything, and a lot of what I know has been
                    self-taught. Outside of school, I have taught myself web development
                    languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and tools (Lambda, VS code),
                    popular frameworks (Python: [requests, matplotlib], JavaScript (TODO):
                    [Node.js, Vue]), and various TCP/IP protocols.

                </p>
                <li><strong>Personal programming experience.</strong> When I have time, I
                    enjoy programming for fun and/or to solve various problems. In addition
                    this website, you can check out my personal programming endeavors here:
