            Slow lorises are a group of several species
            of strepsirrhine primates which make up the
            genus Nycticebus. Found in South and Southeast
            Asia, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast
            India in the west to the Philippines in the
            east, and from the Yunnan province in China
            in the north to the island of Java in the
            south. Although many previous classifications
            recognized as few as a single all-inclusive species, there are now at least eight that are considered valid:
            the Sunda slow loris (N. coucang), Bengal slow loris (N. bengalensis), pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus), Javan
            slow loris (N. javanicus), Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis), N. bancanus, N. borneanus, and N. kayan. The
            group's closest relatives are other lorisids, such as slender lorises, pottos, false pottos, and
            angwantibos. They are also closely related to the remaining lorisoids (the various types of galago), as well
            as the lemurs of Madagascar. Their evolutionary history is uncertain since their fossil record is patchy and
            molecular clock studies have given inconsistent results. Slow lorises have a round head, narrow snout, large
            eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration patterns that are species-dependent. Their arms and legs are
            nearly equal in length, and their trunk is long, allowing them to twist and extend to nearby branches.
