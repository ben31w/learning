# Run AppleScript files
osascript /example/path/to/script.app

# File extensions
- `.scpt` default format
- `.app`  when double-clicked, it runs as an executable

# Tips
- Gotcha: when you run inside Script Editor, you won't be able to see 
  log messages unless you select the 'Messages' tab at the bottom pane.   
  - Default tab is 'Result'
  - If you write a very brief script, you won't be able to see the 'Result'
    tab appear.
