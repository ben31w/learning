A semi-organized collection of programming concepts I've taught myself 
over the years.

Most of my learning has centered around Python (my favorite language for personal
projects) and web development. 

This repo exists to preserve my learning and provide easy access from other 
computers. But I also created it to hold myself accountable. I like looking at 
the contribution graph on my GitHub profile to show that I'm staying active 
with learning and self-improvement.
